--subtract: subtract the volume of it's second from it's first sub object.
--intersect: build the volume shared by both sub objects
--multiply: apply a transform repeatedly to its sub object and unite all resulting volumes

-the clipboard works between several VisEdit instances in tabs or windows of your browser.
-undo: use your browser's back button
-save: the model is always saved to the browser's address field, so it can be bookmarked or copied to any text you like.
-export: the model can be exported in .stl format for reuse in other tools or rapid prototyping machines by pressing s. The .stl file is then downloaded (Chrome, Chromium) or offered as web page to be saved with 'Save page as...'.  This may take some time, rendering the browser unresponsive for a while.
